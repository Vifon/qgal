qgal â€” quick gallery
====================

`qgal` was intended as a `python3 -m http.server` focused on images.
It serves the current directory via HTTP (by default on
`0.0.0.0:5000`) with the previews of all the images in it. The served
directory tree is fully browsable so be aware of what you're
serving/sharing. It is mostly designed for a local and/or LAN usage,
as it does not resize the images for the thumbnails, they are
downscaled client-side. It may change in the future or not.

Some of `qgal`'s goals:
- [X] an easy to use web-based image browser
- [X] a mobile version
- [X] responsive design
- [X] it should never modify any local files; completely stateless operation
- [X] minimal dependencies: Python 3 and Flask

What can to be improved:
- [ ] server-side image downscaling for the previews
- [ ] partial/range HTTP requests for audio/video streaming
